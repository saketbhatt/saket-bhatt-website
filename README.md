## Concept & Philosophy

**Theme:** Discovery through interaction. The site rewards curiosity and exploration, revealing depth and content only to those who engage with it. Minimal, high-contrast, and calm, with subtle motion and hidden layers.

## Structure & Sections

- **Landing:**
	- Almost empty at first glance (cryptic line, blinking cursor, or geometric object)
	- Hidden interaction unlocks the rest of the site (click, scroll, or hover)

- **About:**
	- Gradual reveal (line-by-line, on scroll, or on interaction)
	- Hover/click for footnotes and deeper context

- **Work / Projects:**
	- Projects unlock one by one through interaction (clicking outlines, keyboard shortcut for index view)
	- Each card: short description, tech stack, GitHub/demo link, "why it matters"


## Hidden Interactions & Games (No Spoilers)

- Pattern recognition: Interact with project outlines in a certain sequence to unlock a secret.
- Logic/puzzle: Toggle all project outlines to the same state for a reward.
- Exploration reward: Idle, scroll rhythmically, or click empty space to discover a message.
- Easter eggs: Konami code, footer logo clicks, console hint, ASCII art, debug mode (URL or code), and more.

All are subtle and reward curiosity, not brute force.

## Accessibility & Performance

- Keyboard navigable, ARIA labels, reduced motion support
- Mobile-first, dark mode by default
- Lighthouse: Performance ≥ 90, Accessibility ≥ 90
